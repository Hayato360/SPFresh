# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating SPFresh (a C++ vector search library) with a Rust application. The integration aims to create a high-performance vector search system that leverages the speed and efficiency of SPFresh's C++ implementation while providing a modern, safe API through Rust. The system will support a comprehensive set of vector operations through a RESTful API, similar to the turbopuffer API structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to perform vector search operations through a RESTful API, so that I can find similar vectors efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a search request with a query vector THEN the system SHALL return the most similar vectors based on the specified distance metric.
2. WHEN a client specifies a "top_k" parameter THEN the system SHALL limit results to that number of most similar vectors.
3. WHEN a client provides filter conditions THEN the system SHALL only return results that match those conditions.
4. WHEN a search request is received THEN the system SHALL respond within 50ms for p95 latency.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to insert, update, and delete vectors through a RESTful API, so that I can manage my vector database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends an upsert request with row-based format THEN the system SHALL insert or update vectors accordingly.
2. WHEN a client sends an upsert request with column-based format THEN the system SHALL insert or update vectors accordingly.
3. WHEN a client sends a patch request with row-based format THEN the system SHALL update only the specified fields.
4. WHEN a client sends a patch request with column-based format THEN the system SHALL update only the specified fields.
5. WHEN a client sends a delete request with specific IDs THEN the system SHALL remove those vectors.
6. WHEN a client sends a delete request with filter conditions THEN the system SHALL remove all matching vectors.
7. WHEN write operations include conditions THEN the system SHALL only apply changes if conditions are met.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to convert text to vectors automatically, so that I don't have to pre-process my text data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends text data without vectors THEN the system SHALL generate vectors using FastEmbedding.
2. WHEN multiple text documents are sent in a batch THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently using batched embedding generation.
3. WHEN text embedding is requested THEN the system SHALL normalize vectors according to the distance metric.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the vector search system to be efficient and scalable, so that it can handle large datasets and high query loads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL support at least 1 million vectors with 1536 dimensions.
2. WHEN multiple queries are received simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle at least 100 QPS.
3. WHEN vectors are added or removed THEN the system SHALL maintain search performance.
4. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL efficiently use memory by employing a hybrid memory-disk architecture.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a safe and idiomatic Rust interface to the C++ SPFresh library, so that I can leverage its performance while maintaining Rust's safety guarantees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Rust code interacts with C++ code THEN it SHALL handle memory safely without leaks.
2. WHEN errors occur in the C++ layer THEN they SHALL be properly propagated to Rust with meaningful error messages.
3. WHEN the Rust interface is used THEN it SHALL follow Rust idioms and conventions.
4. WHEN the system is compiled THEN it SHALL properly link the C++ and Rust components.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to configure vector search parameters, so that I can optimize for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a namespace THEN the system SHALL allow specifying the distance metric (cosine_distance or euclidean_squared).
2. WHEN creating a namespace THEN the system SHALL allow defining a schema for attributes.
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN the system SHALL support encryption options for sensitive data.
4. WHEN copying data between namespaces THEN the system SHALL support the copy_from_namespace parameter.

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging, so that I can track system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL log important events and errors.
2. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL track latency metrics.
3. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide detailed error information.
4. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL expose health check endpoints.
