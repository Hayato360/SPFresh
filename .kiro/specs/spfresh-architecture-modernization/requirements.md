# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for modernizing the SPFresh vector search system architecture to implement a comprehensive 8-layer architecture that combines high-performance C++ core components with modern Rust API layers, cloud storage abstraction, and advanced embedding capabilities. The system will provide a production-ready vector search platform with multi-cloud support, sophisticated load balancing, and enterprise-grade features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Layer Architecture Implementation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a well-defined 8-layer architecture so that the system is maintainable, scalable, and follows separation of concerns principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL implement all 8 architectural layers (Client, Load Balancer, API, Embedding, Rust FFI, C++ Interface, SPFresh Core, Storage)
2. WHEN a request flows through the system THEN it SHALL pass through the appropriate layers in the correct sequence
3. IF a layer fails THEN the system SHALL provide proper error handling and isolation to prevent cascade failures
4. WHEN the architecture is reviewed THEN each layer SHALL have clearly defined responsibilities and interfaces

### Requirement 2: Modern Rust API Layer

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want a modern, safe HTTP API built with Axum so that I can interact with the vector search system reliably and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL support all specified endpoints (upsert, update, delete, conditional operations, schema management, encryption)
2. WHEN handling requests THEN the API SHALL use async request handling with Tokio for optimal performance
3. WHEN invalid requests are received THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive request validation with clear error messages
4. WHEN the API is under load THEN it SHALL maintain performance through proper async handling
5. IF authentication is required THEN the system SHALL support secure authentication mechanisms

### Requirement 3: Advanced Embedding Layer Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want sophisticated text-to-vector conversion capabilities so that I can efficiently process and search textual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is submitted for embedding THEN the system SHALL perform proper preprocessing (tokenization, normalization, truncation)
2. WHEN generating vectors THEN the system SHALL use neural model inference with configurable dimensionality control
3. WHEN processing multiple texts THEN the system SHALL use optimal batch processing with batch size of 32 and dynamic batching
4. WHEN running on multi-core systems THEN the embedding layer SHALL utilize SIMD acceleration and multi-threading for performance optimization

### Requirement 4: Cloud Storage Abstraction

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want multi-cloud storage support so that I can deploy the system on AWS, GCP, or Azure without vendor lock-in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring storage THEN the system SHALL support AWS, GCP, and Azure storage backends
2. WHEN switching between cloud providers THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and availability
3. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide proper retry mechanisms and error handling
4. IF cloud credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear authentication error messages

### Requirement 5: High-Performance RocksDB Integration

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want sophisticated RocksDB integration so that the system can handle high-throughput key-value operations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use RocksDB as the high-performance key-value storage backend
2. WHEN under heavy load THEN the RocksDB integration SHALL maintain optimal performance through proper configuration
3. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide efficient read/write operations with minimal latency
4. IF RocksDB operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 6: Load Balancer Layer with GCP Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want intelligent load balancing so that the system can handle high traffic loads with proper health monitoring and auto-scaling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN traffic is received THEN the load balancer SHALL perform health checks and route traffic based on service availability
2. WHEN distributing requests THEN the system SHALL support round-robin, weighted, and geo-based routing strategies
3. WHEN under attack THEN the load balancer SHALL provide SSL termination, DDoS protection, rate limiting, and circuit breaker functionality
4. WHEN load increases THEN the system SHALL trigger auto-scaling based on configurable load patterns
5. IF services become unhealthy THEN the load balancer SHALL automatically route traffic away from failed instances

### Requirement 7: SPFresh Core Engine Enhancement

**User Story:** As a vector search user, I want high-performance vector search capabilities so that I can perform fast and accurate similarity searches on large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vectors are added THEN the SPFresh Update Layer SHALL manage in-memory buffer (Memtable) and LIRE Rebalancer efficiently
2. WHEN performing searches THEN the SPANN Index Layer SHALL utilize centroid index (in-memory) and posting lists (on-disk) for optimal performance
3. WHEN calculating similarities THEN the SPTAG Base Layer SHALL provide accurate vector algorithms and distance calculations
4. WHEN the index grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain search performance through proper index management

### Requirement 8: Rust-C++ FFI Integration

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want seamless Rust-C++ interoperability so that I can leverage the performance of C++ core components through safe Rust interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Rust code calls C++ functions THEN the FFI layer SHALL provide safe and efficient interoperability
2. WHEN data is passed between Rust and C++ THEN the system SHALL maintain memory safety and prevent data corruption
3. WHEN errors occur in C++ code THEN the FFI layer SHALL properly propagate errors to the Rust layer
4. IF FFI calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and proper cleanup

### Requirement 9: Client Layer Support

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want comprehensive client support so that I can integrate the vector search system into web, mobile, and desktop applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clients connect THEN the system SHALL support REST API clients for Web, Mobile, and Desktop applications
2. WHEN communicating THEN the system SHALL use standard HTTP/JSON communication protocols
3. WHEN different client types access the system THEN it SHALL support various access patterns and requirements
4. IF client requests are malformed THEN the system SHALL provide clear error responses with proper HTTP status codes

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability so that I can maintain system health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide health check endpoints for all layers
2. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL expose metrics for monitoring and alerting
3. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL provide structured logging with appropriate log levels
4. IF system components fail THEN monitoring SHALL detect and alert on failures promptly
