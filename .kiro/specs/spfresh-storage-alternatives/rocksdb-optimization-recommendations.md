# RocksDB Optimization Recommendations for SPFresh

Based on our performance analysis of RocksDB with SPFresh workloads at 10K requests/second with 1 billion records, we recommend the following optimizations to improve performance and scalability.

## Configuration Optimizations

### Memory and Cache Settings

```cpp
// Increase block cache for better read performance with large dataset
table_options.block_cache = rocksdb::NewLRUCache(8UL << 30);  // Increase from 3GB to 8GB

// Add row cache for frequently accessed rows
table_options.block_cache_options.row_cache = rocksdb::NewLRUCache(2UL << 30);  // 2GB row cache

// Optimize memtable settings
dbOptions.write_buffer_size = 64UL * 1024 * 1024;  // Increase from 16MB to 64MB
dbOptions.max_write_buffer_number = 4;
dbOptions.min_write_buffer_number_to_merge = 2;
```

### Compaction Settings

```cpp
// Optimize compaction for high-throughput workloads
dbOptions.level_compaction_dynamic_level_bytes = true;
dbOptions.max_background_compactions = 4;
dbOptions.max_background_flushes = 2;

// Add rate limiter to prevent compaction spikes
dbOptions.rate_limiter.reset(rocksdb::NewGenericRateLimiter(150UL << 20));  // 150MB/s
```

### Blob Storage Settings

```cpp
// Optimize blob settings for large values
dbOptions.enable_blob_files = true;
dbOptions.min_blob_size = 256;  // Increase from 64 to 256
dbOptions.blob_file_size = 4UL << 30;  // Reduce from 8GB to 4GB for better management
dbOptions.blob_compression_type = rocksdb::CompressionType::kLZ4Compression;  // Add compression
```

### Parallelism and Threading

```cpp
// Increase parallelism for multi-core systems
dbOptions.IncreaseParallelism(16);  // Set to number of physical cores
dbOptions.max_subcompactions = 8;   // Reduce from 16 to avoid excessive context switching
```

## System-Level Optimizations

### File System and I/O

1. **Use XFS or EXT4 with appropriate mount options**:
   ```
   mount -o noatime,nodiratime,discard /dev/nvme0n1p1 /data/rocksdb
   ```

2. **Increase file descriptors limit**:
   ```
   ulimit -n 65536
   ```

3. **Optimize I/O scheduler for SSDs**:
   ```
   echo noop > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/scheduler
   ```

### Memory Management

1. **Disable transparent huge pages**:
   ```
   echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
   ```

2. **Set swappiness to minimum**:
   ```
   sysctl -w vm.swappiness=1
   ```

## Application-Level Optimizations

### Sharding Strategy

For scaling beyond a single RocksDB instance:

1. **Implement consistent hashing** to distribute data across multiple RocksDB instances
2. **Shard by key prefix** to maintain locality for related data
3. **Consider using 4-8 shards per physical machine** to maximize resource utilization

### Caching Layer

1. **Implement application-level caching** using Redis or a similar in-memory store
2. **Cache frequently accessed keys** based on access patterns
3. **Implement tiered caching** with different TTLs for different data types

### Read/Write Optimization

1. **Use MultiGet for batching reads** to reduce overhead
2. **Use WriteBatch for batching writes** to improve throughput
3. **Implement read-ahead for sequential access patterns**
4. **Consider using column families** to separate different types of data

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Implement regular monitoring** of RocksDB metrics:
   - Block cache hit rate
   - Write amplification
   - Read amplification
   - Compaction statistics

2. **Schedule regular maintenance**:
   - Manual compaction during off-peak hours
   - Periodic database verification
   - Backup and recovery testing

3. **Set up alerts** for:
   - High compaction queue
   - Low cache hit rates
   - Increasing latencies
   - Disk space usage approaching limits

## Scaling Strategy for Beyond 10K QPS

For workloads exceeding 10K QPS or datasets significantly larger than 1 billion records:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Implement a distributed RocksDB cluster
   - Use consistent hashing for data distribution
   - Consider using a service discovery mechanism

2. **Hybrid Storage Approach**:
   - Keep hot data in RocksDB
   - Move cold data to object storage
   - Implement automatic data tiering based on access patterns

3. **Read Replicas**:
   - Set up read-only replicas for read-heavy workloads
   - Implement asynchronous replication
   - Direct read queries to replicas

## Implementation Plan

1. **Immediate Optimizations** (1-2 weeks):
   - Update RocksDB configuration parameters
   - Implement system-level optimizations
   - Set up monitoring and alerting

2. **Short-term Improvements** (2-4 weeks):
   - Implement application-level caching
   - Optimize read/write patterns
   - Conduct performance testing with optimized configuration

3. **Long-term Strategy** (1-3 months):
   - Design and implement sharding strategy
   - Develop hybrid storage approach
   - Set up read replicas for scaling read operations

By implementing these recommendations, we expect to:
- Improve read latency by 30-40%
- Reduce write amplification by 25-30%
- Increase maximum throughput to 15-20K QPS on a single node
- Enable scaling to 50K+ QPS with sharding
- Support efficient storage and retrieval of multi-billion record datasets
