# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SPFresh currently uses RocksDB as its primary storage backend. This feature aims to evaluate alternative storage options for SPFresh, focusing on cloud-based object storage solutions (S3, GCP Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage) and optimizing for the company's specific workload patterns. The goal is to determine if RocksDB is the optimal choice or if another storage solution would better meet our performance, scalability, and cost requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Storage Backend Evaluation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to evaluate if RocksDB is the optimal storage solution for SPFresh, so that I can ensure our system meets performance and scalability requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating RocksDB THEN the system SHALL analyze its performance characteristics with SPFresh's workload
2. WHEN evaluating RocksDB THEN the system SHALL document its strengths and limitations for vector database use cases
3. WHEN evaluating RocksDB THEN the system SHALL identify potential bottlenecks under high load conditions
4. WHEN evaluating RocksDB THEN the system SHALL assess its compatibility with cloud deployment models

### Requirement 2: Cloud Object Storage Integration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to evaluate cloud object storage options (S3, GCP Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage), so that I can determine if they offer advantages over RocksDB for our use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating cloud storage options THEN the system SHALL compare performance characteristics of S3, GCP Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage
2. WHEN evaluating cloud storage options THEN the system SHALL assess cost implications of each solution
3. WHEN evaluating cloud storage options THEN the system SHALL document integration complexity for each option
4. WHEN evaluating cloud storage options THEN the system SHALL analyze data durability and availability guarantees

### Requirement 3: Region-Based Namespace Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to design a namespace architecture based on regions, so that data locality and access patterns can be optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing namespace architecture THEN the system SHALL support region-specific data storage
2. WHEN designing namespace architecture THEN the system SHALL enable cross-region replication when needed
3. WHEN designing namespace architecture THEN the system SHALL optimize data access based on geographic proximity
4. WHEN designing namespace architecture THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance across regions

### Requirement 4: Caching Strategy

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to implement an effective caching strategy, so that frequently accessed data can be retrieved with minimal latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing caching THEN the system SHALL evaluate TurboPuffer for warm cache implementation
2. WHEN implementing caching THEN the system SHALL define cache eviction policies based on access patterns
3. WHEN implementing caching THEN the system SHALL optimize cache size based on workload characteristics
4. WHEN implementing caching THEN the system SHALL measure and document cache hit/miss rates

### Requirement 5: Query Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to optimize query performance across different storage backends, so that user experience remains consistent regardless of the underlying storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizing queries THEN the system SHALL benchmark query performance across different storage options
2. WHEN optimizing queries THEN the system SHALL implement storage-specific query optimizations
3. WHEN optimizing queries THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent query semantics across storage backends
4. WHEN optimizing queries THEN the system SHALL document query latency under various load conditions

### Requirement 6: Storage Interface Abstraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean abstraction layer for storage interfaces, so that the system can work with multiple storage backends without major code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing storage interfaces THEN the system SHALL implement a common abstraction layer for all storage backends
2. WHEN designing storage interfaces THEN the system SHALL enable runtime selection of storage backend
3. WHEN designing storage interfaces THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent error handling across backends
4. WHEN designing storage interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for implementing new storage backends

### Requirement 7: Compatibility Verification

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to verify compatibility between SPFresh and alternative storage solutions, so that I can ensure system stability and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verifying compatibility THEN the system SHALL test all SPFresh operations with each storage backend
2. WHEN verifying compatibility THEN the system SHALL document any limitations or incompatibilities
3. WHEN verifying compatibility THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity across storage transitions
4. WHEN verifying compatibility THEN the system SHALL validate performance under expected workloads
